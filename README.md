# DietPal
    This code defines a function that calculates a person's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height inputs. It then prompts the user to enter their weight and height, calculates their BMI, and displays a message based on their BMI category (underweight, healthy weight, overweight, or obese).

    After displaying the BMI result, the code prompts the user to continue or exit. If the user chooses to continue, the code prompts them for additional information to calculate their Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and the total calories burned based on exercises performed, the number of repetitions, and weight used in kilograms.

    The code gets the user's height in centimeters, age in years, and body weight in kilograms to calculate the user's BMR using the most accurate formula and the metric system. It then uses a dictionary containing the calories burned per minute for each exercise to calculate the total calories burned during the workout.

    The user inputs the exercise intensity (low, moderate, or high), the number of exercises performed, the name of each exercise, and the number of repetitions or the time spent for each exercise. If the exercise is a plank, the user inputs the time spent performing it. If the exercise requires weights, the user inputs the weight used for that exercise.

    The code then calculates the total calories burned and prompts the user to choose between a bulk or cut diet. Finally, the code displays the user's BMR, total calories burned, and total calories expended per day, based on their chosen goal.
